\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
This is a \LaTeX\ style template to be used in the typesetting of the technical essay.
The purpose of the rest of the text included herein is to illustrate the usage of some of the commands that you might want to use.
This is just a template with some relevant text, it is not the full assignment description.
Please read the document \emph{Guidelines for Technical Essay} for the complete requirements for this assignment.


\section{Problem Discussion}

\subsection{Requirements of Form}

\begin{wrapfigure}[10]{r}{0.25\textwidth}

  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{Alice} %Note: no use of .jpg file ending
  \vspace{-0.2cm}
  \caption{A ``wrapped'' figure with the text.}
  \label{fig:Alice}
\end{wrapfigure}

We set the following requirements with respect to format:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item This \LaTeX\ template must be used.
	\item The whole document must be limited to~3~A4~pages of text (references not included).  A technical essay different from three -3- pages of text will be returned to the author
to be cut or enhanced to three pages.
	\item One or more illustrations in the form of figures, tables or diagrams must be included (see \hyperref[fig:Alice]{Figure~\ref*{fig:Alice}}).
	\item The entries in your \hyperref[sec:references]{reference} should be structured as follows:\\
	Author/Origin. \textit{Title}. Where, and when published.
	\item The submitted file format must be pdf.
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{Structure}  If you want  further substructure than sections and subsections, then you can use
a paragraph title like here.  This will look much better than introducing another numbered level of subsubsection.

\subsection{Requirements of Content}
 The text should be intelligible, logical, interesting and easy to read. Write for
your fellow engineering students, and assume that the reader has the same general theoretical
background as yourself. Use definitions, facts and logical argumentation. 

Interpret and refine the title, discuss the problem and intended scope in the
introduction. In the text, do not introduce facts that are not analysed later and
that are not relevant to your problem. Bring your \emph{own analysis and thinking} into
the essay. If you can, bring in new ideas. When you include tables or figures (see \hyperref[fig:linksys]{Figure~\ref*{fig:linksys}}), 
they should be referred to and explained in the text.

While it is allowed to cite Wikipedia or another web page~\cite{Wikipedia:citation,Daborn}, 
it is not recommended.
It is much better if you can refer to a technical article or paper~\cite{Kortvedt:2009}.

\section{Conclusion}
The submitted technical essays will be graded and contribute 20\% to the final grade of the course. The three best essays will be honoured with publication on ItsLearning, edited if necessary, and become part of this year's syllabus.
